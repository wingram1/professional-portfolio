                    <p>Currently enrolled in the Vanderbilt Full-Stack Coding Bootcamp, I am an aspiring web developer. At the ripe young age of 25, I've had experience in various job markets including the industries of music, education, trucking, and supply chain.</p>

                        <li><strong>Video games:</strong> A player and developer, I have participated in three game jams with a group of like-minded individuals with our sights on future jams</li>
                        <li><strong>Running:</strong> I ran a half-marathon in November 2020. I have a dream of one day running a marathon, but I can't seem to stay un-injured!</li>

            <h3>Drip Planner</h3>
            <div class="d-flex flex-row w-100 sub-section">
                <div class="d-flex flex-column w-50 secondary-div">
                    <p>Completed and submitted as my first group project for the Vanderbilt Coding Bootcamp, Drip Planner is a weather application that doubles as a travel application. Made for truck drivers, Drip Planner can grab specific forecasts from the National Weather Service (NWS) API, which the user can then organize into a custom trip.</p>
                    <h4>Technologies Used:</h4>
                    <ul>
                        <li>HTML, CSS, and JavaScript</li>
                        <li>Bootstrap and jQuery</li>
                        <li>Leaflet, a JavaScript library and API used for interactive maps</li>
                        <li>The Official National Weather Service (NWS) API</li>
                        <li>OpenWeatherMap's Geocoding API</li>
                    </ul>
                    <h4>How To Use:</h4>
                    <p>After creating a trip, the user can input a city/state or click the interactive map to generate a forecast for that area. The user can then view additional details of each forecast time-slot and/or add one to the selected trip. When the "Save" button is clicked, the trip will save to the device's local storage and return to the list of user-created trips.</p>

                    <p>Completed for the Vanderbilt Coding Bootcamp, my aptly-named Coding Quiz is a simple-yet-effective basic coding exercise. Once started, a timer will start in the top-right corner. As the user clicks on the provided answer choices for each question, they will see whether they got it wrong or right.</p>
                    <p>When the quiz has finished either via user completion or time depletion, the user can input his/her score to be uploaded to the high scores. The high scores are stored in the device's local storage, and are ranked from highest-to-lowest with only the top 10 displayed.</p>

                <div class="d-flex flex-column w-50 secondary-div">
                    <p>Up2Bar is a team project created in collaboration with <a href="https://github.com/j-maclellan">John Maclellan</a> and <a href="https://github.com/joshlyons225">Josh Lyons</a>. It is a prototype social media application on which users can post & read information about events, bars, and other local happenings.</p>
                    <p>The application is full-stack, meaning we developed both the front-end and back-end from scratch, and it is deployed with Heroku.</p>
                    <p>When looking at the home screen, users can see both a list of posts and an interactive map containing clickable icons that represent and link to each post. When making a post, the user can provide the post's location by entering an address (which is then sent to MapQuest's Geocoding API), clicking somewhere on a new pop-up map, or by using the user's location.</p>
